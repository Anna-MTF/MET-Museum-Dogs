# MET-Museum-Dogs
## A school project at the University of Copehagen for Bachelor Students about Digital Humanities
###### A dataset of a little over 500 objects of dogs from the MET Museum.
This project is about collecting, cleaning, organizing and sharing data. The project has highlighted how we can build a relational database using Open Access data from a museum, and how a dataset can be set up with tables and joint tables.
The relations and cardinalities can be seen in the data model provided.
